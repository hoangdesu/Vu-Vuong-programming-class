# LASER - [**L**]c3 [**AS**]sembl[**ER**]

## Description

Laser is a cross-platform, command-line-based assembler for the LC3 assembly 
language implemented in pure C. Version 2 extends the functionality of LC3Tools 
and LC3Edit through new pseudoops, along with a project assembly mode.

## Installing

Under the releases tab, there are pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Mac, and 
Linux. In addition, it is highly recommended that you use this program with an 
extensible editor like VSCode or Notepad++, and to add Laser as a shortcut in 
your editor. If all this installation stuff is not up your alley or you'd like 
to learn more about how Laser was created, take a look at 
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions on how to build Laser from source.

### Linux/Mac OS X

Once you've downloaded the precompiled binary (building from source is actually 
recommended on Linux due to all the different distrubutions and their 
differences, but Laser has practically 0 dependencies so it should be fine), 
copy the file to either `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable. 
Alternatively, put it wherever and add it to your PATH environment variable.

## Usage
